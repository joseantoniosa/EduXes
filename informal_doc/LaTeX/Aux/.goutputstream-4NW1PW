 a) Build development environment: 
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.6 is downloaded from: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
As root user that file is unpacked into /usr/lib/jvm and configured to be the Java default:

	Furthermore JQuery, JQueryMobile and Phonegap are needed, and were downloaded from their web sites:
JQuery 1.8.1 (no newer versions):
http://jquery.com/ 
JQuery will be  copied into assets/www/js folder.
JQueryMobile version 1.1.1 from

JQueryMobile is a zip file which will be uncompressed and copied into 
assets/www/js folder.
	PhoneGap - Cordova 1.8.1 is downloaded from this URL:

 c) Make a simple application: only a blank page.
Getting started with Android is followed step by step.
 d) Upload simple application into a git repository. 
A Github account is created and a new application is initialized.  This are the source code project page:\cite{EduXes}
Source code are upload to GitHub:

$ git init
$ git add -A *
$ git remote add  EduXes git@github.com:joseantoniosa/EduXes.git

\end{verbatim}
\end{bclogo}




Every time an update is going to be uploaded:
$ git add -A *
$ git commit -m 'CHANGES_DESCRIPTION'
$ git push origin master

 e)  JQueryMobile1 applications are structured in pages (<div data-role=
