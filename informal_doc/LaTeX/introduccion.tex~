\chapter{Introduction}
In a high school, there are classes which attendance, assessment and group dynamics is difficult to control.
This is especially relevant for the technology workshop, this could be a noisy, annoying, even dangerous place, which requires teacher's supervision. This workshop requires a lightweight,
reliable and complete  software tool. A simple web solution is not enough, and even use a tablet can be heavy, it requires a new approach.
  
The development of a multiplatform tool, open source, for smart-phones, including tablets, for attendance monitoring and evaluation of students is suggested.
 To achieve this goal a client-side application will be developed using a multiplataform framework: Phonegap (Cordova) \cite{PhoneGap}.
Phonegap allows you to develop utilizing well-known languages as Javascript and HTML. It permit us to deploy an application for both Android,
WebOS, iOS and others.    

For data management, a built-in database, SQLite, will be employed.
  
The tool that enables rapid development of the application and integration of performance tests is Eclipse. It uses the Android virtual machine (AVM).
