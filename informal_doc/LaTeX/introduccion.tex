\chapter{Introduction}
In a high school, there are classes which attendance, assessment and group dynamics is difficult to control.
This is especially relevant for the technology workshop, this could be a noisy, annoying, even dangerous place, which requires teacher's standing monmitoring.
 This workshop needs a lightweight,
reliable and also complete  software tool. A simple web solution is not enough, because it could be too complicated and not fast enough; even use a tablet can be heavy. Therefore, this problem requires a new approach.
  
The development of a multiplatform tool, open source, for smartphones, including tablets, for attendance monitoring and evaluation of students is suggested.
 To achieve this goal a client-side application will be developed using a multiplataform framework: Phonegap (Cordova) \cite{PhoneGap}.
Phonegap allows you to develop quickly, utilizing well-known languages as Javascript and HTML. It permit us to deploy an application for both
 Android, WebOS, iOS and others.    

For data management, a built-in database, SQLite, will be employed which has all capabilities needed (autoincremental indexes, relation among tables and several built-in functions ).
  
The tool that enables rapid development of the application and integration of performance tests is Eclipse. Also Eclipse is well integrated with Android SDK, and its Android virtual machine (AVM).
