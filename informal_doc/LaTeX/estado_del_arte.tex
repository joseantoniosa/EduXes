\chapter{State-of-art solutions}


	Only an open source application was found for study, Siestta  ,  nevertheless there are a lot of educational software (Sixa2, Unisoft3) but they are privative, Microsoft Windows freeware or both (SAS académico4). 
	Siestta was evaluated. 
Technically it is an GPL'ed old style PHP-based web application with Ajax, an interactive editor, fckeditor and fpdf to generate reports.
From user point-of-view there are online documentation5. This application includes management of students, attendance, marks, tasks, incidents, general queries, letters to parents, interviews with parents, messages, appointments, exams and more.
	Several screen-shots were taken and will be reused in current application:


\section{Siestta}

This application (Siestta) are also available for PDAs, it could be a valid solution but it is server-side with outdated technologies. Data structure from Siestta is standard and fully functional, and it could be partially reused by EduXes.
Source code are also shown: calendario.php. It shows us a PHP application which uses sessions variables and is not Model-View-Controller oriented.
